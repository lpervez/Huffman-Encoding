# Huffman-Encoding
There are two major components to this project: 1. Implementing three supporting data structures: a. A hash table using Linear Probing
b. A priority queue implemented as a sorted Singly Linked List 
c. A Binary Tree with linked nodes 
2. Using those data structures to implement Huffmanâ€™s algorithm, including:
a. Constructing a Huffman Tree 
b. Traversing the tree for encoding/decoding
